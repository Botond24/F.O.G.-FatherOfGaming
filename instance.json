It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow. Many of our players report a **250% to 500% increase** in average frame rates.\n\n- AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / AMD Radeon RX 580 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/949043152138956850/2022-03-03_21.34.58.png) 88 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/949043152810041384/2022-03-03_21.36.59.png) 418 fps)\n- Intel Core i3-6100U / Intel HD Graphics 520 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948649845651025930/2022-03-02_13.31.51.png) 17 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948649845961396294/2022-03-02_13.24.50.png) 73 fps)\n- AMD Ryzen 7 3700X / NVIDIA RTX 3080 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948678492634120292/2022-03-02_21.28.37.png) 61 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948678830430769182/2022-03-02_21.26.02.png) 251 fps)\n- AMD Ryzen 3 3200G / AMD Vega 8 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948659691125350410/2022-03-02_19.13.34.png) 58 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948659690802380840/2022-03-02_19.10.59.png) 173 fps)\n- Intel Core i5-3330 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948704894758580284/2022-03-02_23.13.44.png) 36 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948704895362551879/2022-03-02_23.03.29.png) 89 fps) \n- Intel Core i7-10700K / NVIDIA GTX 1660 SUPER ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948645822730489906/2022-03-02_19.16.28.png) 81 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948645834067689483/2022-03-02_19.18.16.png) 256 fps)\n- Intel Core i7-1165G7 / NVIDIA GeForce MX450 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948643441926086746/2022-03-02_13.09.37.png) 45 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948643441305333800/2022-03-02_13.04.25.png) 156 fps)\n\nEven for very slow or unusual machines, people often report significant improvements.\n\n- AMD Athlon II M300 / ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4500/5100 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948660512244244490/2022-03-03_00.00.28.png) 9 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/948660512487518318/2022-03-03_00.12.49.png) 47 fps)\n- Nintendo Switch / ARMv8 Quad-Core CPU / NVIDIA Tegra X1 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/949130022797586452/2022-03-03_21.19.39.png) 37 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948635624729112596/949130039285383208/2022-03-03_21.11.34.png) 108 fps)\n\n# ✅ Hardware Compatibility\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should [make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409137348877-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Game-Crashes-and-Performance-Issues-FAQ#h_01FFNR5S1APTFHGR9K2W3JANZ4). Out-of-date drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.",

          "description": "No-compromises game logic/server optimization mod",
          "body": "Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n",

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.",

          "description": "Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo",
          "body": "Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.",

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p style=\"color: red\">Please, when you write the name of this mod, don't add spaces.</p>**\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Mod loader: Fabric]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-Fabric-1976d2?style=flat-square&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[Fabric API]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api \"Fabric API CurseForge page\"\n[ModMenu]: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\n[Sodium]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium \"Sodium CurseForge page\"\n[Canvas]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer \"Canvas CurseForge page\"\n[LambdAurora Discord]: https://discord.gg/abEbzzv\n",

Support for this mod is provided on a \"best-effort\" basis. This is not my day job, it is a hobby growing out of related work I've done.\n\n## Sponsor Me!\n\nDid this mod make your server playable? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.",

Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support` channels!\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/303440391124942858/widget.png?style=banner3)](https://discord.gg/lat)",

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)",

The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.\n\nThis mod doesn't add anything besides making it compatible with Fabric, however there are plans later to add some exclusive content and possibly tweak some of the current content. For more info about the mod itself see the [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) page.\n",

          "body": "Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n",

 \n*A zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n  \nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n  \n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n",

My job, my school and the development of DML itself takes so much time that I just can't play.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So I'd like to hear the opinion of people who are actually playing with it, tell me what you are thinking of the mod so far. Report me bugs, broken mechanics, too OP items (or even items that needed to be more powerful than they actually are), etc. I'd be grateful to hear everyone's opinion, just leave a comment in this section and I'll read <strong>and I'll consider your opinion</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">It also Features</h2>\n<h3>Roughly Enough Items (REI) Integration</h3>\n<p>This mod provides integration with <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items\">REI</a>.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

I know I've promised to deliver it sooner, but I have had a lot of stuff happening in real life.\n\nI've also decided to pause development for the 1.18.2 versions. Once I make sufficient progress on the 1.19.2 version, I might update the 1.18.2 versions for Forge or Fabric as I did with the big backport. Until then, I wanted to make this current version the most stable for everyone. Keeping up with all these versions is very tiring and time-consuming for me, and also makes development slow. I'm sorry to disappoint anyone, but I'm just one guy.</b>\n\n- fixed a crash caused by the Iberian village. Some jigsaws would turn into packed mud upon worldgen, making the game crash;\n- fixed bug where waystones would not spawn in the Iberian village (from both FWaystones and Blaire's Waystone mod).",

No more!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">At a time where there's a lot of mods and even more items, you'll need functional and capable backpack. Since the traveler's backpack can provide about <strong>45 inventory slots</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2 fluid tanks</strong>, which each can store up to 4 buckets of fluid or even 16 bottles of potion&nbsp;(Now even more, since it's configurable!), this backpack becomes a really good option to consider. All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - <strong>sort</strong>, <strong>quick stack</strong> and <strong>transfer</strong> to seamlessly manage inventory!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Chestplate or backpack? Why not both? (Now with Curios integration! 1.16+)</span></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. Player can wear one backpack on his back at the time and it's inventory can be accessed via <strong>B</strong> (Configurable) button.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>The best gear for adventures!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here comes the Traveler's Backpack! You are able to use crafting inside of backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag in any time you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described below), which render directly on backpack. Fluid tanks in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described below) are good portable fluid storage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UkVUU6N.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1903\" height=\"723\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Customization that you have never seen!</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! All backpacks' textures have been remade one by one to fit new Minecraft style. 1.16+ versions provide <strong>dyed backpack</strong>. You can combine whichever dyes you want!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6nzBlK2.png\" width=\"1123\" height=\"1009\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Inventory guide</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Traveler's backpack inventory can be split into segments, which have different functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Here you can see the inventory:</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/inwSgPA.gif\" width=\"900\" height=\"963\" /></p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Blue slots&nbsp;</strong></span>stand for base backpack inventory, where you can store your items.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Green slots&nbsp;</strong></span>accept only tools and provide special inventory action - Tool cycle (See below)</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Brown slots</strong>&nbsp;</span>are mostly crafting grid and one of them is crafting result slot.

Tank is selected if its border is white, this also means that hose is active. Hose attachment resets everytime when you take off your backpack or remove hose from inventory, so make sure that any of the tanks is selected. There are 3 hose modes, which I'll describe below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Suck Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can pick up the fluid from the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from clicked tank to your backpack's tank.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spill Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">You can spill the fluid into the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from your backpack's tank to clicked tank.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Drink Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allows player to drink some tank's contents - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not all fluids are drinkable</span>, some of them may give special effects though.</p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Additional Tips</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swap tank attached to hose</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wear a backpack and hold hose, click <strong>N</strong> to swap tank which hose is attached to. (Configurable in controls)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change hose</strong><strong> mode</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you hold hose, hold <strong>Z </strong>(Configurable in controls) and <strong>scroll up or down </strong>(can be set to use keybind only in config)&nbsp;to change active hose mode.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong><b>Swap tool</b></strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You can perform this action if you're holding a tool, wearing a backpack and at least one tool slot isn't empty in backpack's inventory. At first hold&nbsp;<strong>Z</strong> (Configurable), then scroll up or down (Can be set to use keybind only in config). It will replace your current tool with one from tool slot. Such a useful trick!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Open inventory</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you wear a backpack, click <strong>B</strong> to open inventory. (Configurable in controls)</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Drain fluid from fluid tanks</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Hold shift and click on chosen tank to drain fluid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/paFy9EG.png\" width=\"1903\" height=\"655\" /></span></p>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Abilities</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">As you may know (or not know) some backpacks can provide special, mostly (not?) useful abilities. They appear while player's wearing backpack and few of them provide abilities in block form.

You can then go back and retrieve your lost items. The mod will remember your inventory layout and put everything back to where it was before you died. The mod is highly configurable. In fact, if you think a config is missing that has anything to do with what happens when you die, it's not refered to as a missing feature, but a bug. (Not really but that's how serious I am about everything being configurable). \n\n \n\nIf you play multiplayer you'll have no trouble finding which grave is yours, as both your face and player name will render on it (if you've enabled it in the config of course)\n\n \n\n## Features\n\nThe mod is available for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, and 1.18!\n\nAs 1.18 is the newest version of minecraft, 1.18 will be the version most updates are pushed to. This is why you will often find more features in this version than the other versions. However once in a while the 1.16.5 and 1.17.1 will be backported from the newest version. Any issues found with earlier versions will also be handled.\n\nThe mod aims to be compatible with most, if not all inventory mods. Currently You're in Grave Danger provides compat for: inventorio [all versions], trinkets [all versions], curios [1.16], travelers backpack [1.16, 1.17]\n\nOther inventory mods are also compatible with this mod, including backslot, extra inventory and BigInv. The mod will also work with infinitory, however that compatibility is not well tested. If any of the listed mods would not be compatible, or you know another mod affecting the inventory, please open an issue in the mod github repository, or report it in the discord server.\n\nThe mod is technically compatible with every soulbound enchantment, since you can configure which enchantments should not be dropped on death in your grave, and which you should as well keep in your inventory when you respawn. \n\nGraves can be waterlogged, and renders can be adapted to the block the grave is standing on.\n\nGraves can be completely customized with resource packs in all versions. They will affect block hitbox, render parts, the grave skull and grave text. \n\nMore features are also provided, however some of these are disabled by default as most people probably don't want these issues as a part of the mod. \n\n## Misc info\n\nIf you find any bug/missing config, or have a cool idea that would fit in the theme of the mod, please open an issue on the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/B1n-ry/Youre-in-grave-danger/issues)\n\nThe mod is under MIT license, so feel free to use this in your modpack!\n\nThis mod is required both on client and server, as it will add custom blocks and renderers.\n\n\nWant more info about how to configure the mod for modpacks and servers or similar?

          "body": "Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.",

You can place as many of them as you like on your system\nand remote access them through the ME Requester Terminal. The terminal allows you to configure the\nrequests and monitor the status remotely.\n\nThe number of slots a Requester supports can be configured as well as its channel and idle energy usage.\n\nIf you previously used the mod [Lazier AE2], you might be familiar with the Requester. We decided to decouple\nthe Requester features from it and make it a standalone mod.\n\nThe whole system has been rewritten and also supports fluids now!\n\n## **⏰ Changelog**\nEverything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].\n\n## **🎓 License**\nThis project is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0][license].\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[minecraft]: https://www.minecraft.net/\n[ae2]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2\n[forge]: http://files.minecraftforge.net/\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net/\n[lazier ae2]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazierae2\n[releases]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/releases\n[changelog]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/blob/1.19-forge/CHANGELOG.md\n[license]: https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester/blob/1.19-forge/LICENSE\n",

There is an active community of data pack makers on the Discord, with ready-made data packs for you to download and enjoy, as well as for getting help if you want to try your hand at creating your own data pack.\n\nIf you want to get started, I suggest visiting the wiki of the mod on GitHub: https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki\n\n## Community\nThere are a lot of enthusiasts of the mod and people who make data packs on the Discord!

If you are a user, this means this mod does nothing on it's own and you should only install it when using another mod that depends on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Install the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrcrayfish\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MrCrayfish</strong></span></a> if you want in-game configuration!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This port became necessary as I wasn't able to find an existing config api on Fabric which suited my needs, also I have a bunch of code built on top of Forge's api, so just porting the api was the easiest solution. Any other dev seeking to use the Forge config api on Fabric to maintain their project(s) on both loaders is welcome to use this library. Instructions on how to add Forge Config API Port to your development workspace can be found on the GitHub page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you're using a multiloader Gradle setup for your workspace, e.g. as demonstrated <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>here</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jared</strong></span></a>, Forge Config API Port is especially useful, as it can be directly added to the common sub project, so that all Forge config features can be used in any sub project, mod loader specific code only being required once when registering configs. It's really neat, believe me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code>, or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Default in-game configuration will be added when the related <a href=\"https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/8874\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>PR</strong></span></a> is finalized and merged into Forge.

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

These can be found in Village Libraries, Stronghold Libraries, and Ruined Portal chests. When you read a Spell Book, you will learn how to cast a spell.\n\nSpell Books contain the Pattern that defines a given Spell.\n\n### Spell Casting:\nCasting Spells requires that you know a given Spell. All you have to do is have a Wand in your main hand, and use the Left and Right Mouse Buttons to create the Pattern of a Spell.\n\n### Mana Flasks:\nMana Flasks are a way for Mages to store Mana for later. In order to fill a Mana Flask, all you have to do is Sneak + hold Right Click, while having at least 5 Mana available.\n\n### Display Case:\nDisplay Cases are decorative blocks that can hold any item. To open or close them, all you have to do is Shift + Right Click them, and to place an item in them all you have to do is Right Click it while it's open with the item you wish to place inside.\n\nDisplay Cases also are able to emit a Comparator output depending on whether they're open or closed.\n</details>\n\nYou can use `/spells list` at any time to see all the spells, as well as their patterns, that you know.\n\n---\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n    <tr>\n        <th><b>Join my Discord</b></th>\n        <th><b>Join my Ko-Fi!</b></th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th><a href=\"https://discord.gg/f5dFYWX\"><img src=\"https://cammiescorner.dev/images/extras/discord.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" title=\"Cammie's Corner Discord\" alt=\"Cammie's Corner Discord\"></a></th>\n        <th><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/camellias/tiers\"><img src=\"https://cammiescorner.dev/images/extras/kofi.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" title=\"Cammie's Corner Patreon\" alt=\"Cammie's Corner Patreon\"></a></th>\n    </tr>\n</table>",
